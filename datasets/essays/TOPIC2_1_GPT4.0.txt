Fixing a broken fan may seem like a complicated task, but with a step-by-step approach, it becomes a manageable and even satisfying process. The first and most important step is safety—always unplug the fan before inspecting it. Begin by examining the exterior for obvious issues such as loose screws, broken blades, or damaged cords. If the fan blades are stuck or not spinning freely, accumulated dust or debris may be the culprit. Removing the protective grill and cleaning the blades and motor housing with a soft brush or cloth can often restore normal function.

If cleaning does not solve the problem, the next step is to check the electrical components. Carefully open the fan’s casing using a screwdriver and inspect the wiring. A loose connection or burnt wire can interrupt power flow. If you have a multimeter, test the continuity of the switch and the capacitor. The capacitor, a small cylindrical component, helps the motor start. A faulty capacitor is a common issue and can be replaced with an identical one available at hardware stores. Lubricating the motor shaft with a few drops of machine oil can also help if friction is preventing movement.

Once repairs are complete, reassemble the fan securely and test it by plugging it back in. With attention to detail and a few basic tools, repairing a broken fan is not only possible but practical.
