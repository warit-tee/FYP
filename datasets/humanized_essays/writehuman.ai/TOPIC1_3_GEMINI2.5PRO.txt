Adolescents using social media is no longer a novelty. It has become a constant and necessary feature of modern development. Digital social spaces have changed from a simple replication of real-world social spaces into an extraordinary influential realm concerning one’s identity, thoughts, and feelings. While its users are marketed an idealized and sanitized corporate narrative of social media and its use as a tool for connection, expression, and a global community, they seem to conveniently forget to mention a more disturbing truth. Social media is primarily designed not for user flourishing, but to extract profit through addictive user engagement to capture and monetize their activity data. Users participate in social media to realize superficial relationships, while its psychological harms are deep and foundational.

The rapid decline of youth mental health is one of the most visible and detrimental consequences of the phenomenon described in the paragraph above. This is because the cause of this decline can be attributed directly and logically to the prevailing design of social media. Adolescent users of the image-based social media platforms, for instance, Instagram and TikTok, are particularly vulnerable to the socio-psychological impacts of the social comparison, which is one of the most dominant and relentless features of these platforms. Adolescents are targeted by hyper-sensationalized and hyper-anchored social validation with the help of algorithms. They are exposed to a global and multi-channeled stream of most beautiful, highly successful, and filtered images, which are accompanied by emotionally positive and happy portrayals of life and situations. This distortion leads to a complete psychological breakdown. The phenomenon is obviously causative to the vertically relentless social media stream, which is designed to engage users for long periods and promote unwinnable gauntlet impact of social comparison. The system is designed to create and engage users in a dopamine feedback loop by promoting social validation through FOLLOWERS and LIKES.

The design of certain systems is exploitative by default, and determines the predatory nature of the exploitation. Tech companies recruit behavioral specialists to create systems that are dangerously addictive and capture the same neural pathways as gambling machines. Tech companies design systems to ensure maximum "time on device" is spent through the use of precision tools. For children and adolescents, the developing brain is still constructing the prefrontal cortex, and thus, this is an unfair battle. Unfettered corporations are, for all intents and purposes, being allowed to carry out huge, unrestricted, and uncontrolled neurological research on a complete generation. All of this is being done while prioritizing the value of shareholders and offering little to no consideration for the cognitive and emotional autonomy of children.

The impact is not just emotional; it is cognitive as well. The very medium of the technology is changing how young people think. The design of these platforms encourages the creation of content that is quick, visceral, and emotional, while content that is nuanced, complex, and demands attention is actively discouraged. The brain is conditioned to seek instant, novel, and high stimulus content, and that preference is reinforced when scrolling through a series of 30 videos and images. The cognitive "muscles" that are needed for deep reading and analysis are being atrophied. The “immediate gratification” that is offered in the content is the opposite of what is needed, and most people do not have the cognitive resources or the conditioning to put together complex information. That "information access" advocates celebrate is a fallacy when the user has been cognitively conditioned to be incapable of processing that information critically.

The social and civil architecture is, in essence, inspiring decay. Disengagement algorithms treat outrage as the most dependable attention magnet. As a result, polarization and empathy-vanishing algorithms speed up the capture of young users in outrage-disguised polarization “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers.” Users’ radicalized beliefs do not gain opposition; they are taught not to seek controversy or other points of view. They are steeped in radical tribalism. In place of authentic discussion, the system encourages outrage, social signaling, and “cancel culture” theater. The system solicits and closes the channel to social engagement. The system is empathy-vanishing. It encourages manipulation, conspiracy, and disinformation, and cripples the capacity to engage young people as informed, collaborative citizens.

One of the most common responses argues social media is an essential lifeline for young people* and especially for *marginalized* youth, like LGBTQ+ teens and people with disabilities. That is, it is for the teens who find community and support online that is missing in their immediate social and physical environments. While this observation has some merit, it is ultimately an over-simplistic and naive conclusion to draw. Admittedly, there are some supportive environments. However, these are * established* as secondary to the mainstream purpose of the social media platforms. Claiming these vulnerable users as their primary clients would be highly inappropriate. These users obviously will seek some digital refuge, even though the social media ecosystem is largely dominated by extreme cyberbullying, targeted harassment, predatory users, and hate speech radicalization. The community these users find is very different from the positive social support network they seek. Like the social media platform as a whole, this "community" is grounded in fragile, performative, and manipulative algorithms. The platform is likely to be more harmful than the inadequate help it purports to offer.

One of the most common arguments made by tech companies is the one that positions parental controls and digital literacy as the solution. This is, quite self-servingly, an avoidance of responsibility. This is the 21st century’s version of the tobacco industry blaming the smokers for lack of willpower and addiction. To expect a lone parent or child to stage a meaningful counter-offensive to a multi-trillion dollar industry that has spent countless resources to hold their attention is entirely unreasonable. The issue is not the user, but the system’s predatory design.

To conclude, without necessary reforms, social media will continue to inflict damage on the young. The social connections may come in handy, but they are unintended to value the mental blight, cognitive drifting, and the social disintegration these platforms cultivate. These apps are not neutral; they are attention-sucking traps designed for monetization. The model profit and loss criteria are based on the deterioration of mental health among youth. The mental health crisis among youth is not a problem of user addiction. Focusing efforts on treating the use of social media as a personal choice will continue to neglect the mental health of an entire generation. After treating social media and its mental health ramifications as an issue of personal responsibility, the lack of regulations will indicate the worst, a social media pandemic, mental health crisis, and neglect to a whole generation.
