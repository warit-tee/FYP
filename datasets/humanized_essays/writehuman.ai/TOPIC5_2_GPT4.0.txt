Waking up on Saturday mornings this way was pure joy. I would cozy up with my blanket and cereal while watching old cartoons. I always looked forward to watching Tom and Jerry. I caught old episodes on television and I even had a few tapes. I often imagined the settings while listening to the music. It was a simple show, yet it charmed and captivated the imagination of children. 

The characters were mostly mute, save for a few lines, yet the show was able to engage the audience with storytelling. I even imagined the characters were talking while listening to the music. Silence, for the child watching the show, was a form of storytelling. Exaggerated character actions portrayed and communicated the thoughts and ideas. It was a fascinating form of communication I later appreciated.

The show had a hint of mischief and defiance that enthralled me too. Watching the tiny mouse Jerry turn the tables on Tom on so many occasions and so creatively was a joy. Each time, I relished seeing the delivered the expected outcome no one else thought possible. I was certainly a quiet and timid child, and feeling underestimated is never fun, and feeling one step ahead was something I certainly cherished about Jerry's attitude. His many triumphs instilled the feeling that small was certainly not a synonym for powerless.

There was also the feeling of bonding for the family, and so the show’s entertainment value multiplied. My father and mother, not usually treating my cartoon enthusiasms with the same value and always finding other shows too silly for a laugh, would laugh with me at Tom's antics. I still remember the humor in the chaos that made my mother shake her head in disbelief. Those moments of laughter and bonding, however, were simple in themselves, with no other virtue, and so fleeting that I was amazed at how they changed the feeling of the day.

Thinking back on my childhood, I fondly remember the animated series, Tom and Jerry. I think, at least in part, my affection for the series was because it was the first thing that taught me creativity. More profoundly, it taught me resilience and how a story could be constructed. By simply and effectively show a few minutes of a cat and a mouse, the series got the world to see the fact that humor does not have to be crude or overly complex to be appreciated. I can still remember the days when I could find joy in a simple thing, say a mouse, Jerry, repeatedly outwitting a cat, Tom, and all while watching a new episode Back then, I found joy in watching and outwitting the episodic cat.

With the world around me, becoming even more complex and intricate, I find myself even more appreciative of the joy Tom and Jerry continues to bring. Tom and Jerry was, more than a series, simple and childish, a constant companion, and first teacher. I find myself even more joyful of the spark it continues to bring to my days. For all this and more, the series will always hold a special place for me.
