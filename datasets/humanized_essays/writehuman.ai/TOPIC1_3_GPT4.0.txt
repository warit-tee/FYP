The past few years have seen social media change the ways in which people communicate, share ideas, and express themselves. To social media users, and especially today’s youth, it is more than a communication tool. It is an integral part of everyday life. Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and Twitter provide the venues in which young people concentrate in the search for identity, validation, and community. It is true that social media can provide unique ways of self expression, learning, and social connection, but the reality is much more complicated. It is increasingly clear that social media negatively impacts youth more than it positively affects them. These impacts include social and developmental issues, heightened addictive behaviors, and self perception distortions. Given these, social media serves more as a problem than as a solution for the younger population. This is an issue that must be addressed.

Among many others, effects that social media has on mental health, particularly the youth’s, has been the most discussed and studied. Several studies state that there is a clear correlation between increased negative mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety, and increased social media use. Social media users tend to engage with and pay attention to profiles that are designed to showcase ideal standards of beauty, success, and happiness, and are much more likely to incorporate these beliefs into their self-assessments. Self-worth is still developing during the teenage years, and constant social exposure to peers and influencers amplifies the impacts of digital comparison, often resulting in deep inequalities and dissatisfied self-assessments. Young social media users internalize and personalize images of so-called perfect bodies and lives. Chronic devaluation and self-criticism tend to result from the social comparison. Young people are especially prone to these self-criticism cycles, especially when combined with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The social media landscape leaves many youth feeling as though others are leading more riveting and satisfying lives than their own.

Negative effects of social media are evident in its impact on young people's self-perception and how they see others. Social media fosters a ‘performative’ approach to self-worth. Instead of being based on character and moral values, self-worth is calculated based on likes, followers, and views. This leads many young people to shape their online identities around social acceptability, which is in stark contrast to their real self. The need for social media validation as a self-worth and confidence booster is distortion of self image and a self-reinforcing scaffold of external validation. Furthermore, beauty filters and harmful online challenges are examples of viral trends that encourage risky behavior in young people as they try to gain online recognition. The digital environment fosters a focus on the superficial and a misplaced sense of worth that prioritizes popularity over intrinsic values and character.The decline of interpersonal communication and social skills in real life is equally concerning. Interactions on social media are quick and emotionally shallow. No messages or emojis can substitute for the complex meaning brought by tone and body language in real life. Digital platforms are becoming the main form of communication for many. People are losing basic communication competencies, such as starting a conversation, conflict resolution, or reading body language. This phenomenon is troubling for the education and workplace environments. Social media permissions of distance and anonymity encourage hate speech, cyberbullying, and other forms of online abuse. Emotional distress is a major consequence of online harassment. This trauma can last a lifetime.

Social media influence on youth is linked to addiction as well. All social media platforms have the same goal of maximizing user engagement. This is done by employing various psychological tricks such as variable rewards and notifications. Users engage in compulsive behavior and have an irresistible urge to check updates, likes, and messages. This compulsive behavior is increasingly difficult to control. With adolescents having the least self-regulation to control their screen time, social media becomes all the more dangerous. Disruption of healthy sleep, the attention span of an individual, and overall productivity becomes an issue. Neglecting other activities in life such as physical exercise, academic work, and real-life connectivity to pursue social media makes life more difficult to manage.

On the other hand, one cannot deny the positives the platforms bring. Social media enables the young to form connections and develop an understanding of communities across the world, fostering networks of inclusivity and appreciation. For those who face societal hurdles (like the queer and disabled young), social media can be a unique venue to garner aid, tell their stories, and bring attention to important issues. Moreover, young people can use these sites as an outlet for their educational and advocacy activities, giving them a voice in important social and political matters. Social media was also an important tool during the pandemic, as people relied on it to remain socially connected and access vital information. These benefits do not, however, eliminate the risks these platforms pose. Social media can be a constructive and positive instrument, but without proper guidance it can also become an dangerous and addictive tool, especially for the young.

Countering social media's negative impact on young people will require an integrated strategy. Parents and schools have to collaborate on teaching digital literacy, which entails responsible and safe usage of the internet. Young people need to learn how to analyze and recognize the workings of algorithms, spot false information, and critically evaluate the content. In the same breath, parents need to put reasonable limits and show healthy social media habits themselves. Governments and social media companies have to take further actions to minimize harmful content, create platforms that consider the social media user's age, and reveal the details of algorithms and data usage. The objective should be to help young people safely and mindfully use social media instruments instead of banning the tools.

To summarize, social media has caused daunting changes to the young people’s mental, emotional, and social development, most of which are negative. Social media can bond and give people power, but the potential risks of social media, including anxiety, addiction, social disengagement, and low self-worth, outweigh the positives. It is imperative to protect the younger at-risk population. Social media’s benefit for young people is only possible with the development of healthy usage practices, increased critical awareness, and social media platform accountability. Social media should not be a high risk. Instead, social media should be a positive for young people.
