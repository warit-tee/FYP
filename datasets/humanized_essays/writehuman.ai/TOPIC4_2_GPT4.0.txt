The Rapid Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (Ai) Makes It Possible To Create New Opportunities While Causing Great Ethical Disturbances. The Promises Of Ai Include Improvements In Health Care, Industry, Education, And Even Transportation. It Also Creates Questions About The Abuse Of Power, Equity, Responsibility, And The Right To Privacy. The Development Of Ai Must Be Safe, Ethical, And Focused On The Positive Impact It Will Have On The World.

The Most Significant Threat Is The Idea Of Bias In The Algorithm. Every Ai Algorithm Is Trained Using Data, And Often The Data Is A Reflection Of The Biases Present In The Society. Consequently, Discriminatory Practices Can Be Developed. For Example, In The Justice System, The Ai Technologies Used To Assess Historical Data Have Systematically Disadvantaged Members Of Certain Racial And Ethnic Groups. This Is Most Certainly Not A Technical Question- It Is A Question Of Justice. Equity Will Not Be Achieved If Ai Is Left To Use The Injustices Of The Past To Create New Standards. It Is Absolutely Essential That Ai Bias Be Systematically Controlled.

There is the issue of accountability as well. With the advent of autonomous AI capabilities, the question of who is to be held accountable for the negative ramifications of the AI's actions becomes salient. For example, in the case of a self-driving car getting into an accident, or an autonomous AI in the healthcare sector giving a harmful recommendation, who is liable—the AI's developer, the AI's user, or the implementing company? Lack of accountability enables blame to be passed without consequence. There is a need for ethical AI to provide the means and the mechanisms of accountable blame. 

For many AI systems designed to perform various tasks, collection of personal, behavioral, and other sensitive information is a standard prerequisite of AI functionality. In many cases, this is done without informed consent and understanding of the user. Governments and companies perform behavioral surveillance, and condition and predict behavior to be assisted with automated systems. Proponents argue AI surveillance provides security and the efficiency. However, automated decision systems can be detrimental to personal decision-making. There is a need for ethical AI to provide automated decision systems while having privacy protection measures in place.

The claim that ethics may decelerate innovation is valid in certain contexts. Yet, the claim that ethics may block progress is sharply misguided. Ethics is not a block. Harmful consequences that require rapid response may be associated with unethical AI behavior. Designing ethical beliefs in ethical AI builds relational trust and facilitates human-friendly progress.

The ethical risks accompanying the promise of artificial intelligence must not be ignored. Risk of bias, unaccountability, and invasion of a person’s privacy all present danger. Meeting these risks is not merely a technical obligation but an ethical necessity. If attention is shifted to these ethical principles in implementing AI, human beings will be the focus, and technology will respond to that focus.
