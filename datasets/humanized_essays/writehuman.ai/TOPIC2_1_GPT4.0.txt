Although fixing a broken fan might seem complicated, it can be quite simple and,perhaps, enjoyable when systematically approached. The first and, most, important step is to ensure safety. Unplug the fan before trying to see what is wrong with it. Start checking the outside for simple things like loose screws, broken blades and damaged cords. If blades are stuck and not spinning at all, a lack of dusting may be the issue. Simply removing the protective grill and dusting the blades and motor housing with a soft brush or cloth works wonders and can save a stuck fan.

After cleaning the fan, if the issue is still not resolved, the next step involves the checking the electrical parts. Using simple common tools like a screwdriver to open the fan casing and inspecting the wiring is a good first step. A loose burnt connection or wire can be power stopping. If you have a multimeter, you can also check the continuity of the switch and the capacitor. The capacitor, a small cylindrical component, helps the motor to start, and If it is faulty, it can be a common issue and can be, also, replaced cheaply. If you notice friction is preventing the part movement, you may also lubricate the motor shaft with a few drops of machine oil.

After you finish the repairs, put the fan back together, ensuring that it is secure, and test the fan by plugging it back in. With some attention to detail and a few simple tools, it is practical and possible to fix a broken fan.
