Initially focused on facilitating connectivity, expression and learning, social media has progressed into a space for creativity and engagement on a global scale. Nevertheless, social media's impact on youth has become an increasing cause for concern. The negative effects of social media on youth outweigh the positives. Multiple studies show the impact of social media on mental health, self-esteem, and attention span.

Anxiety and depression rates among adolescents have increased, and social media portrayals of hyper-reality fuel depression further. Instagram and TikTok, for example, propagate unrealistic beauty standards and idealized body types which lead to poor body image and self-worth. The psychological toll of social media is the result of cyberbullying which is perpetrated through, and largely enhanced by, the digital devices and platforms that youth carry with them 24/7, thereby making abusive comments and messages virtually inescapable. 

Social media has restructured the processing of information, and in conjunction with the endless feeds of content and instant gratification, the platforms have substantially influenced a decline in attention span and active engagement to meaningful tasks, critically thinking, and academic activities.

Although certain critics highlight creativity and global awareness as important contributions of social media, the addictive nature of social media platforms and the possible psychological strain outweigh the advantages. Therefore, teaching the youth on mindful social media use and the implementation of more robust digital literacy programs, for the negative effects to be less impactful, is important. Social media platforms should be a tool, not a trap, for the youth.
