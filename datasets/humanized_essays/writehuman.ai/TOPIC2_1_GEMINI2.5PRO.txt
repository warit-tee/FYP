Having a silent standstill fan on a hot day is frustrating; however, getting it going is oftentimes a surprisingly simple task. Before thinking about buying a new fan, a few simple diagnostics and maintenance actions are more than probable to solve the problem. This is a money saver and is a rewarding task to accomplish. The focus is to use a structured method; and for any electrical repair, the first and most important is to ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power source.

To get started, unplug it and set it down on a sturdy workspace. The first maintenance action is to do a visual inspection. Look for frays or any damage on the power cord. Try moving the fan blades; if it is stiff or doesn’t move the problem is with the motor spindle. Things that can move like tangles and hair or other debris around the motor and spindle can be the problem. If the blades move with the fan but the fan is not spinning you can start to think it is an electrical problem, but most cases cleaning it will solve the problem.

Carefully take apart the fan's protective cage. Typically, this unit is fixed by clips or small screws. It will give you access to the blades and the housing of the motor. Use a cloth or compressed air to meticulously remove the dust and dirt from the blades, cage, and from around the motor. Dust buildup may cause overheating and seize the motor. When cleaning is done, use a few drops of electric motor oil or a similar light lubricant to the small shaft in the center of the blades. Put the fan back together, making sure everything is in place, and plug the fan in to test the repair. Revived with a little patience and effort, your fan should be circulating air with a gentle whir.
