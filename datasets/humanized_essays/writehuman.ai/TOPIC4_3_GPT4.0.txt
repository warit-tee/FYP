As each new AI system is developed and implemented into new areas of daily life, ethical concerns are growing more and more complex. Controversial AI applications such as real-time facial recognition and automated killing machines demonstrate AI’s rapid growth and increasing influence. AI’s potential applications in improving productivity, streamlining educational and healthcare services, and optimizing administrative tasks are exceedingly positive. However, the risks associated with AI can be tremendous too. The ethical concerns computing technologies pose are real, immediate, and practical. They affect the issues of privacy, autonomy, equity, and human dignity, and must, therefore, be resolved. Ongoing human technological innovation must be accompanied by the preservation of core human values. The need and the demands of ethical AI scrutiny are urgent.

The issue surrounding the accountability of AI systems tends to elicit strong emotions. Who is responsible when an AI system denies a loan, misdiagnoses a patient, or causes an accident in an autonomous vehicle? Developers, users, and policymakers must collaborate on balancing guidelines to ensure liability is assigned to an appropriate party to AI system decisions. AI systems are unlike any technology available today—they can operate without human input and, therefore, require a new legal and ethical approach to accountability. Leaving the public in a legal and ethical void, and without countermeasures to prevent potential harm, is tantamount to recklessness. The potential harm must be guaranteed legal responsibility.

There are ethical considerations such as bias and equity. AI systems cannot be more impartial than the data they are trained on and, frequently, these data sets include the historical bias information in society. AI systems used in recruiting practices that are trained on data such as historical gender bias information tend to favor male candidates more than female candidates. Moreover, predictive policing algorithms have systematically targeted people of color and reinforced systemic inequities. The ethical mandates are obvious. AI systems require design and upkeep to uphold equity rather than injustice. To uphold this, there must be more transparent algorithm design, inclusive and diverse teams, and ongoing auditing to mitigate bias.

AI presents numerous ethical challenges in the field of Privacy. Highly intelligent systems can collect, process, and analyze information, often without consent. This raises privacy concerns. For instance, governments and private entities use and abuse facial recognition and surveillance technologies to track and analyze the behavior of people who have not consented. This can lead to surveillance managed social systems. Personal freedoms are lost for the sake of efficiency and security. Ethical systems, without a doubt, should advocate and ensure the observance of privacy rights through informed consent and the principles of data minimization. 

The adverse impact of integrating AI technologies in the workplace raises additional ethical challenges. Employment and resultant AI induced economic disparity present challenges for corrective equity. Inequities resultant from productivity gains and new industry creation are lost jobs, especially in the manufacturing, transportation, and customer service sectors. Displaced jobs could destabilize a society if corrective policies are not enacted. Safeguards in the form of social nets, job retraining, and universal basic income are required to ensure gains and the disruptive impacts of artificial intelligence on employment are equitably managed.

Philosophically speaking, can AI ever have moral status? As machines become more complex in imitating people’s behavior and emotions, questions arise regarding their moral status. Even though machines have neither consciousness nor sentience, their mimicry might provoke thoughts regarding sentience. Should machines be treated ethically simply because they mimic people? Certain AI systems may provoke ethical dilemmas, but most would agree that moral status can only be afforded to sentient beings. The humankind-with-AI interaction might, though, signal a change in culture and ethics. For example, the routinization of cruelty to human-shaped machines may expose people to normal cruelty, which is a concern because of the potential AI designs may have on the person’s behavior and empathy.

The integration of AI in warfare poses serious ethical challenges. Armed autonomous weapons systems, often called "killer robots," can select and engage targets without any human intervention. Possibly using autonomous weapons technology in warfare raises ethical issues on the erosion of human conscience and the dangerous tendency of allowing machines to make life and death decisions. Therefore, the world should quickly draft agreements and laws to potentially limit the scope of autonomous weapons systems. Human beings must always retain the last decision in warfare. Humanitarian laws mandate this and should always be preserved.

Nevertheless, to view AI solely from a dystopian lens and to completely ignore the positive advancements possible with AI, would be a terrible error. AI can improve human life and welfare in many ways, from diagnosing diseases to improving accessibility for people with disabilities. The positive ethical use of AI must be rooted in a human-centered approach, focused on dignity, justice, transparency, and accountability. Overall, technological advancements should serve people, not the other way around.

To conclude, the ethics surrounding artificial intelligence must be prioritized in order to promote equity and inclusivity. The inclusion of AI in everyday activities makes current AI design and use decisions critical for the long-term future. Instead of repeatedly asking what AI is capable of, one must begin to ask what AI is allowed to do. For this to be achieved, continuous conversations must take place between technology designers, moral philosophers, politicians, and society to ensure innovation does not disregard the ethics of our humanity. It is only under such circumstances, and with the needed critical collective reflection, that the potential of AI can be used ethically.
