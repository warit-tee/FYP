The opening theme was music to my ears and my childhood mornings. "Tom and Jerry" was a household cartoon. Nothing was as entertaining as watching an endless hunt of a house cat and a clever mouse. I was always mesmerized and loved watching Tom and his scheming/baffoonery. I loved to watch how all his elaborate plans would magically unravel all due to Jerry’s cleverness. 

The cartoons magic, I believe, was in it's internationality. The use of no dialogue, only expressive/animated gestures and a perfectly aligned soundtrack to each event, beat and change of emotion, told a story. I grew to understand the unvoiced slabstick humour even as a child and felt the laughter in the room. It was an uncomplicated joy, an entertainer that required no engagement but still gave satisfaction in a predictable manner.

Looking back on "Tom and Jerry," I can see that it encapsulated the simple essence of childhood. It was an experience where challenges were trivial, disputes could be ridiculously funny, and one slapstick explosion was all that stood between you and a blissful resolution. "Tom and Jerry" was, and still is, a wonderful way to entertain yourself without the need to exercise your mind with moral ideals. It is a source of blissful, persistent, and everlasting memories.
