With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), the society and technology confrontation emerges most philosophically. It deals most fundamentally with the question of the absence of fairness in the decisions made by AI systems on peoples lives. Still, the powerful productivity, medical, and convenience breakthroughs technology ameliorates the everyday balances the ethical disadvantages and questions. 

Underestimating the ethical implications of the biases and unfairness. AI systems depend on the social and historical context of the data used for training. Resulting discrimination exactly replicating us social discrimination systems. The legal and ethical implications of targeting AI in employment and surveillance/policing systems are thrown. Distributing targeting the consequences of decision made by AI systems challenge the ethical arena: AI systems lack moral agency and AI systems are present in the daily levels of the infrastructure in us.

Autonomous AI systems are reshaping accountability and control. The more complex the task—whether it be automated driving or trading—machines are more likely to produce unpredictable results. Concerning the development of such systems, the consideration of human rights, ethics, and corporate interests with AI profit and technological advancement should be regulation priorities. The development of any technology will always be accompanied by the techno-ethical dilemma involved. In the case of AI, the most important ethical aspect is to be human-centered. The final decision and use of the technology should always be outside the scope of the AI.
