Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is the first book in J.K. Rowling’s celebrated series. More than a fantasy tale about a boy finding out he’s a wizard, it is a fascinating book about the complex issues of identity, friendship, and the opposition of good and evil. The story is about Harry Potter. He is an orphan who has been abused by his relatives and finds out on his 11th birthday that he has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, that he is a wizard. Upon entering the magical world, he discovers the truth about his parents’ mysterious death and begins to construct his own identity independent of the past.

The integration of a traditional coming-of-age story with magical realism and elements of mystery lends the novel a compelling and engaging structure. Through Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Rowling pays tribute to the exemplary virtues of loyalty, courage, and intellect. The trio’s friendship and alliance become instrumental in overcoming the obstacles protecting the Philosopher’s Stone. Despite being physically absent for much of the book, the main antagonist Lord Voldemort’s presence is felt, as he is the embodiment of evil and the destructive power of ambition. Harry is shown that, through Dumbledore, the mentor figure, true essence is found in the choices one makes, not in the innate abilities one possesses, and that, ultimately, one is defined by one’s actions. 

The Mirror of Erised, the Sorting Hat, and the Philosopher’s Stone, for example, are tools that Rowling employs to deepen the story by adding layers of complexity. The novel, however, focuses on the coming-of-age narrative. Its themes are universal, and the characters are vividly and memorably drawn. It is, lend to a modern classic, of great literary value and not merely for children.
