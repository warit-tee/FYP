The innovation of artificial intelligence has given society a range of ethical challenges that require attention. As these systems advance, the ability of autonomous systems to make decisions raises issues regarding equity, accountability, and the right to privacy. It is a societal rather than a purely technical issue. It is essential that we come to terms with the answer to the question of what values we ought to incorporate into the digital systems we design.  

The most central ethical challenge is the complexity of algorithmic bias. AI models are trained on large datasets that are sometimes infused with societal and historical bias. An AI that is discriminatory in hiring practices will prefer applications from certain demographic groups while a judicial AI will recommend harsher sentences based on data. The absence of bias creates a real danger concerning equity. The absence of bias creates a real danger concerning equity. Automating injustice will happen on a scale never seen before.Lastly, accountability for autonomous systems is still a significant challenge. When a self-driving car gets into an accident or a medical AI tool misdiagnoses a patient, who is to blame? Is it the fault of the programmer, the car's owner, or the car? There needs to be legally definable and ethically clear accountability, or the trust of the public will be lost. There also needs to be the ethical loss definability so victims of autonomous AI can have recourse and not have responsibility loss. While AI's more critical tasks increase, the risk and oversight systems are concurrently. The lack of oversight will ensure these powerful tools serve humanity's best interests.
