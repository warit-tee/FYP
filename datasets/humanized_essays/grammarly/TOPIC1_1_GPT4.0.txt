Social media has changed how young people connect, learn, and share their thoughts. While it gives them chances to be creative and interact with others around the world, there are growing concerns about its impact. More and more evidence shows that social media can harm young people’s mental health, self-esteem, and ability to focus.

A major concern is the increase in anxiety and depression among teenagers. Seeing only the best parts of other people’s lives online can make young people feel like they don’t measure up. Apps like Instagram and TikTok often show unrealistic beauty standards, which can hurt self-esteem and lead to body image problems. On top of that, cyberbullying is now easier to do and harder to avoid, since negative comments and messages can reach young people anywhere, anytime.

Social media also makes it harder for young people to pay attention for long periods. The constant scrolling and fast-paced content make people want quick rewards, which can take away from time spent on reading, studying, or thinking deeply. This can hurt school performance and change the way young people take in information.

Some people say social media helps young people be creative and learn about the world. However, these positives are often less important than the way the platforms are designed to be addictive and the stress they cause. It is important to teach young people how to use social media wisely and to have better digital literacy programs to reduce the harm. Social media should help young people, not hold them back.
