Social media has become a big part of young people’s lives, but it is designed to keep them engaged, often at a cost. Although these platforms are praised for helping people connect, this positive aspect is outweighed by the harm they cause to teens’ mental health and real social growth. The main issue is the constant pressure to compare themselves to others and to seek approval through likes and followers.

Teens are at a stage where they are figuring out who they are, but social media shows them only the best parts of other people’s lives. This makes it hard for them to feel good about their own reality and leads to more anxiety, depression, and body image problems. Research shows that spending more than three hours a day on social media can double the risk of mental health issues. When self-worth depends on likes and followers, young people get stuck looking for approval from others instead of building real confidence.

These platforms also replace real, caring conversations with quick and shallow online interactions. As a result, important social skills are lost, and many teens feel more alone, even though they are always connected. With the added risks of cyberbullying and harmful content, the downsides of social media are clear. Society needs to stop seeing social media as just harmless fun and start treating it as a serious issue that needs strong rules and better education to keep young people safe.
