It’s frustrating when your fan stops working on a hot day, but fixing it is often easier than you might think. Before you decide to buy a new one, try a few simple checks and maintenance steps. You might save money and feel good about solving the problem yourself. The most important thing to remember is to always unplug the fan before you start any repairs.

Start by unplugging the fan and setting it on a steady surface. Look it over carefully. Check the power cord for any signs of damage. Try turning the blades by hand. If they are hard to move, the problem could be with the motor’s spindle. Sometimes, things like hair or dust can get stuck and stop the blades. If the blades move easily but the fan still doesn’t work, the problem might be electrical, but usually, a good cleaning helps.

Take off the fan’s protective cover, which is usually held in place by clips or small screws. This lets you reach the blades and the motor. Use a cloth or some compressed air to clean away all the dust and dirt from the blades, the cover, and around the motor. Too much dust can make the motor overheat and stop working. After cleaning, put a few drops of electric motor oil or another light oil on the shaft in the center of the blades. Put everything back together, plug the fan in, and see if it works. With a little patience, your fan should be working again.
