Unquestionably, social media has changed how young people interact, educate themselves, and express themselves. Although it provides chances for creativity and international communication, its effects on young people are becoming a growing cause for concern. There is mounting evidence that social media negatively impacts young people's attention spans, mental health, and self-esteem, supporting the claim that it causes more harm than good.

One of the most alarming consequences is the rise in anxiety and depression among adolescents. Persistent exposure to carefully chosen, romanticized depictions of other people's lives can cause comparison anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. Unrealistic beauty standards are frequently promoted by apps like Instagram and TikTok, which makes young users doubt their own value and struggle with body image. In a digital world where messages and comments follow young people across all devices, cyberbullying has made it easier to commit and more difficult to avoid, adding to the psychological toll.

Additionally, social media promotes fleeting engagement and short attention spans. In addition to rewarding instant gratification, the constant scrolling and rapid content consumption impair concentration on more complex, meaningful tasks like reading, studying, and critical thinking. This has an impact on young people's information processing as well as their academic achievement.

Although some contend that social media encourages creativity and global awareness, these advantages are frequently outweighed by the platforms' addictive qualities and the mental stress they inflict. To lessen the negative effects, it is crucial to implement more stringent digital literacy programs and teach young people how to use technology mindfully. Young minds should use social media as a tool, not a trap.
