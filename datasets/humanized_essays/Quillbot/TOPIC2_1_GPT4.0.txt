Although fixing a broken fan might seem like a difficult undertaking, it can be made manageable and even enjoyable by following a methodical approach. Safety is the first and most crucial step; always unplug the fan before checking it. Start by checking the outside for obvious problems like broken blades, loose screws, or damaged cords. Dust or debris buildup could be the cause of stuck or non-spinning fan blades. Normal operation can frequently be restored by removing the protective grill and using a soft brush or cloth to clean the motor housing and blades.

Checking the electrical components is the next step if cleaning doesn't resolve the issue. Using a screwdriver, carefully open the fan's casing to examine the wiring. Power flow can be interrupted by a burned wire or a loose connection. Check the switch and capacitor's continuity with a multimeter if you have one. A tiny, cylindrical part called the capacitor aids in the motor's startup. A common problem is a malfunctioning capacitor, which can be replaced with a similar one found at hardware stores. If friction is impeding movement, lubricating the motor shaft with a few drops of machine oil can also be beneficial.

After the repairs are finished, put the fan back together safely and plug it in to test it. It is not only feasible but also feasible to fix a broken fan with a few simple tools and careful attention to detail.
