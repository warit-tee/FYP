Repairing a fan can look quite technical. However, with a step-by-step approach, it is manageable and enjoyable. First of all, it is important to be safe by unplugging the fan. Begin by examining the outside for obvious faults, such as loose screws, broken blades, or damaged cables. A dust buildup or debris could be preventing the blades from moving freely. Cleaning the blades and motor housing with a soft brush or cloth after removing the protective grill usually does the trick.

Consequently, if cleaning proves ineffective in resolving the problem, then the electrical components must be prepared to inspect. A screwdriver is used to open the casing of the fan carefully, and the wiring is inspected. If wires are burnt or loose at the terminals, the flow of power is, of course, interrupted. If you find an opportunity to use your multimeter, check for continuity for both switch and capacitor. The capacitor, a small cylindrical object, essentially helps to start the motor. Failure of the capacitor is a fairly common issue; it can be replaced with a new one identical in specifications available in hardware stores. Another fix is to give the motor shaft a little lubrication, just 2 or 3 drops of machine oil, should friction hinder any movement.

Once this is done, the next step is to fortify the assembly of the fan and to test out by plugging it in once again. Keeping in mind these instructions and some simple tools, the maintenance of the broken fan is not just possible but also doable.
