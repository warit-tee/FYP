A childhood is often set against the dazzling, brightly flickering palette of Saturday morning cartoons. The brightest colors in my sky and the most pronounced of my memories stem from the chaotic, comic, and, surprisingly, sentimental world of Tom and Jerry. More than just a TV show, it became a daily ritual, a source of immeasurable laughter, and an early lesson in perseverance. The basic storyline of a cat chasing after a mouse in vain somehow forged its way into my developmental years and away from the screen, into my heart, into my memory, and into the saga of how I thought about narratives and humor.

The iconic orchestral swell of the opening theme signalled the dropping of everything every single afternoon. It was common ritual for my siblings and I to be cuddled up in front of the television set. We needed no complex narration to grasp the story for our generation of Tom and Jerry was a slapstick poetry known to all. We would laugh till our bellies nearly ached at Tom engineering these Rube Goldberg contraptions that were purposely meant to trap Jerry but would go back at him in a weird way. Jerry would also find a way out with his own brand of sly wit, making him a sympathetic little hero; that very laughter, pure and unadulterated, was the glue bonding us together and shaping a good memory from my childhood.

The show contained a tacitgoing message of perseverance, aside from all the jokes thrown at viewers. Tom, however hilariously angling himself to death under a falling piano, was still there in the very next frame, not even the faintest glimmer of death or defeat in his eyes. In that sense, he is the perfect embodiment of carry-on-try spirit, even if it meant and implied another anvil falling on his head. Jerry had become an expert in lateral thinking and ingenious methods of dockfighting, the subtle lesson being that wit and intelligence supersede brawn. Their never-ending cycle was in consideration of neither evil nor kinship, but a rather peculiar symbiotic rivalry. They were defined through the chase, and there in that pursuit, I found a simple yet deeply meaningful story that tells of confrontation with creativity and an indomitable spirit.

The genius of animation is ever upon us all. Each seven-minute demonstration was a fluid motion very moveable in the application of character design and expressions-orchestral score by Scott Bradley that timed every hit, tick, clang, or plunge to the utmost perfection. It was a lesson in non-verbal communication: an eyebrow raised by Tom and a cocky smirk on Jerry said more than could ever be put into a full page of dialogue. This timelessness has continued to charm generations of new viewers, lasting in a world particularly spaced out by modern dialogue-driven cartoons. It was, and remains, utterly visual poetry.

Tom and Jerry was more than just my favorite cartoon-back then it really was a cornerstone of my childhood. It taught me that laughter is one of the most powerful things; resilience is required; and an appreciation for unadulterated artistry needs to exist in a person. The show gave me a reliable escape into a world of delightful absurdity, and those echoes still resound in my sense of humor and belief that even after the most spectacular failure, you can always bounce back on your feet ready for a new chase.
