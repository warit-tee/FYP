Artificial intelligence becomes ever more integrated into modern society, creating a tangled web of ethical questions that must be addressed with care and attention. As these more advanced systems evolve to take decisions autonomously, we must begin to question immediate issues of fairness, accountability, and privacy. The making of ethical AI is not purely a technical problem, but a social concern that requires us to seriously decide on what values we shall incorporate into our digital creatures.

Increased integration of AI in modern society has brought forth a myriad of ethical questions that need thorough consideration. With the advance of more sophisticated systems that operate autonomously, we begin to question everyday issues of fairness, accountability, and privacy. Ethical AI design does not merely concern itself with technics but must be addressed on a social level as well--seriously contemplating which values should be ingrained in our digital creations.

One of the major ethical concerns remains bias in the algorithms. AI algorithms learn from large datasets, which contain, by and large, those historical and societal biases. An unchecked AI might, in a hiring context, discriminate against candidates from some demographic group; whereas, an AI in the judicial domain, might recommend harsher sentences based on biased data. This, therefore, creates a compelling need for transparency and thorough testing so these systems empower people and do not worsen discrimination. Without conscious effort, one wonders on what scale prejudice will be automated.

Another challenge that can delay the introduction of new technology into society is how responsibility is distributed when these systems operate independently. Accidents with self-driving cars, and misdiagnoses by medical AI pose an amazing difficulty to determine who is at fault. Is it the breach of contract of the programmer who failed to code the system safely; the co-owner of the car; or the manufacturer? Establishing such clear hands in legal and ethics will build public confidence and ensure that the deployment of autonomous AI will not create an abyss of responsibility where unfortunate victims find no recourse. The more tasks we entrust to AI, the more we must design mechanisms for counteract risk and assure that these powerful tools always work for humanity.
