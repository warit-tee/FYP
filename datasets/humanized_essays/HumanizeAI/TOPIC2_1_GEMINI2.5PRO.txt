A silent stationary fan on a hot day can be frustrating, while reviving it is most times a simple repair. Most problems can be diagnosed or remedied with a few checks before you make that purchase of a new one. This saves money and grants that feeling of fulfillment. The key is in applying logic to troubleshoot: first thing first in any electrical trouble-shooting-an appliance must be completely disconnected from its power source.

Unplug the fan and set it firmly on a work table. Begin with a visual examination. Look for frays or other damages to the power cord. Turn the blades using your hand; if they feel stiff or refuse to move, the problem usually lies in the motor spindle. Hairs and dust may obstruct movement. However, if the blades spin freely but it refuses to turn on, the problem is electrical, though most times, the answer is cleaning.

Remove the protective cage by carefully depressing the small clips or unscrewing small screws that hold it in place. This will give you access to the blade and the motor housing. After removing the dust, dirt, and grime that have accumulated on the blades, cage, and around the motor with small brush, cloth, or blast of compressed air, keep in mind that if left there, the dust will cause the motor to overheat, and it will ultimately seize. Next, a few drops of electric motor oil or any light oil should be dripped onto the small shaft situated in the center of the blades. Reassemble everything tightly, plug it in, and test your work. Your fan will now be whirling softly, distributing air all around, a rebirth only induced by a little patience and earnest labor!
