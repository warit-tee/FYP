It can be stated without reasonable objections that social media changed the mode in which the youth connect, learn, and express themselves. Yet, creative opportunities alongside world interaction do the flip; therefore, the more serious is the worry for the youth. It is believed that social media does more harm than good, and such belief is upheld by ample and increasing evidence on its ill effects vis-a-vis social media.

Anxiety and depression are among the most frightening results in adolescents. Constant viewing of advertisements or pictures or videos showcasing the lives of others from a glitzy and glam point of view instills a certain feeling of inadequacy and comparison. Social platforms like Instagram and TikTok promote unrealistic beauty standards to the extent that they cause some questioning of their worth and developing body image issues among youths. This mental trauma is being exacerbated by the rise of cyberbullying; it is now easier to bully and harder to escape in a digital world, with comments and messages following youth around on all devices.

In addition, social media promotes distractible thinking and shallow engagement. In the time it takes for a post to move out of sight, one scrolls into a fit of gratification-the craving extends to activities that require attention and focus-things like reading or studying, calling for deep analytical work. This in turn crystallizes distraction and rejection of good performance in coevals and changes the way in which youngsters process information.

Some people see social media as a tool for enhancing creativity and worldwide awareness, but these advantages probably pale in comparison to the frustrating design of social media platforms and the intrinsic toll on one's psyche. So, there should be an emphasis on educating youth in conscious usage and implementing more strict digital literacy education to curb the adverse impact. Social media should be a tool for young minds, not a snare for them.
