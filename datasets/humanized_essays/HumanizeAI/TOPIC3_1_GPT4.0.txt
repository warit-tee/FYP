The first book of J. K. Rowling's legendary series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, is more than just a tale of a boy who learns that he is a wizard—it is a book that primarily deals with the issues of the self, the boy's relationship with others, and the clash between good and evil. It is a story that revolves around Harry Potter, a boy whose parents died when he was an infant and who is living with very cruel and mean relatives. He gets to know on the day of his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard and that he can attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Not only does he find out the truth of his parents' mysterious death but he also starts to develop his own personality, separate from that of the past, as he enters the world of magic.

The plot of the novel combines the usual coming-of-age tale, and magical realism as well as the mystery of the unknown. Through the introduction of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Rowling speaks of the friendship being based on loyalty, courage, and intelligence. This friendship is a major force that helps them to face up to the challenges that are protecting the Philosopher's Stone. The villain, Lord Voldemort, though physically absent for most of the time, can be felt all over, as he is the one representing the evildoers' threat and the dangers that come with the ambitions that are not controlled. Dumbledore is the one who leads the boy and gives him moral support and he also gradually teaches Harry that it is the choices we make rather than the powers we possess that determine who we really are.

The Mirror of Erised, the Sorting Hat, and the Philosopher's Stone itself—are all symbols that Rowling employs to enrich the text with different meanings. This book is primarily about growth, moral integrity, and the overpowering force of love, which at last are the underlying narratives of the whole series. It is not only the children's book but rather a modern classic with timeless literary value, as it is characterized by universal themes and unforgettable characters.
