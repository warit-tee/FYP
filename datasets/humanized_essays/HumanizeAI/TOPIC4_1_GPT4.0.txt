The swift surge of AI has culminated in a discourse about the ethical concerns, with few major questions on the role technology plays in society. At the core of the discussion is the fact that decisions affecting human lives are made by AI systems or entities, and those decisions can ever be considered fair, unbiased, and accountable. While the AI offers benefits of up-lifting productivity, medical breakthroughs, and conveniences of daily life, the accompanying ethical issues are too grave to look away from.

One of the biggest ethical problems is that of algorithmic biases. AI systems are only as objective as the data they are trained on, and if a data source embodies social inequalities, then the results might perpetuate or exacerbate discrimination. For example, AI has, in some cases, led to disproportionately affecting marginalized communities in hiring or policing. It then begs the question: who becomes accountable for an AI making a decision that harms or is unjust toward individuals? AI, unlike humans, lacks moral agency; nevertheless, the outcomes induced by its decisions are real, often hardest hit upon by vulnerable sections of society.

The growing autonomy of AI systems threatens traditional responsibilities and controls. As machines become more involved in complex tasks-they trade systematically and autonomously, for example-an element of the unexpected increases. This also adds requirements for transparent AI development and for regulatory frameworks that respect human rights and ethical considerations rather than corporations' profits or artistic innovation.

Artificial intelligence is, fundamentally, human ethics. Therefore, with the introduction of AI systems into daily life, it must be ensured that its development is aligned with democratic values, equity, and public good. Such an ethical consideration for AI is not a choice; it is a necessity-if we want to build a just and inclusive future.
