J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is an excellent example of a children's fantasy. However, the author's outstanding narrative skill is demonstrated through the use of classic literary archetypes that not only entertain but also communicate deep themes. The story presents the heroic journey literally and metaphorically by the child's protagonist, Harry going up to the magical and fateful world. He is "called to adventure" by the massive issuance of letters from Hogwarts, then crossing Platform 9 ¾ into a place where he needs to bear a set of trials. So his magical power is not the only means he uses but along with the main themes of friendship and valor he emerges victorious. The devotion of Ron Weasley and the wisdom of Hermione Granger indeed support him and make him realize that socializing and being good with others also are powerful magical forms.

The main issue is the Philosopher's Stone, which is a strong metaphor for the greed of power and immortality that the villain, Voldemort, is after. This is in stark contrast to Harry's aims that the Mirror of Erised reveals; they are not power but family and love—the very things that safeguard him. The high point of the story has Harry picking self-denial instead of selfishness, giving up the Stone's power so that it does not have to be misused. In the end, the book states that the most significant magic is not in spells or potions but in love's victory over fear and the bravery to do what is right even if it is hard, all of which open the door to the unending good versus evil battle that characterizes the series.
