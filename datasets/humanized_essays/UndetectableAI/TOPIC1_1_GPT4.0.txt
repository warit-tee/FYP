Young people now use social media platforms to establish relationships and acquire knowledge and share their personal expressions. Social media provides users with creative opportunities and worldwide connections yet it creates rising concerns about its effects on young people. The evidence shows that social media creates more problems than benefits for young people because it damages their mental health and self-confidence and shortens their attention span.

The increasing number of adolescents develop depression and anxiety because of social media exposure. People who view perfect life content on social media platforms develop negative self-perceptions through comparison. Young users of Instagram and TikTok encounter unattainable beauty standards which make them doubt their worth and develop body image problems. The digital world makes it difficult for young people to avoid cyberbullying because they face continuous harassment through all their connected devices.

Social media platforms promote brief attention spans while promoting shallow user interactions. The social media system provides users with quick content access which leads to instant rewards but weakens their capacity to concentrate on substantial activities including reading and studying and critical thinking. Young people experience two major effects from social media usage because it damages their academic results and changes their information processing methods.

The creative advantages and worldwide understanding benefits of social media do not compensate for its addictive nature and negative impact on mental health. Young people need to learn responsible social media habits through digital literacy programs which should be established to protect them from negative effects. Social media exists to serve young people rather than to create a destructive environment for their minds.
