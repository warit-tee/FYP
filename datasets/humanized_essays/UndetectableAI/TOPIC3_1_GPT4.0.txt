The first book of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone presents itself as a basic wizard story yet delivers complex literary elements which explore identity and friendship and the eternal conflict between good and evil. The story begins when Harry Potter discovers his wizard heritage on his eleventh birthday after learning he received admission to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry discovers his parents' mysterious death while he discovers his own identity which exists independently from his family history.

The story follows a classic coming-of-age story while incorporating magical elements and mysterious plot points. Through Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger Rowling demonstrates how loyalty and courage and intelligence create value in life. The trio uses their friendship to overcome obstacles which protect the Philosopher’s Stone. Lord Voldemort serves as the main antagonist through his absence throughout most of the story while his presence creates an ongoing danger that demonstrates how ambition without control leads to evil. Dumbledore serves as Harry's mentor by teaching him that our true nature emerges from our choices rather than our natural talents.

The author uses the Mirror of Erised and the Sorting Hat and the Philosopher’s Stone as symbolic elements which create multiple interpretations throughout the story. The book establishes essential elements which will develop into a story about personal development and ethical conduct and the eternal strength of love. The book contains themes which appeal to all ages through its memorable characters which establish it as a timeless literary masterpiece.
