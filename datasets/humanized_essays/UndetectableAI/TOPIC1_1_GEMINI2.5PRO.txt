Young people face a harmful environment through social media integration because these platforms operate to maximize user engagement. The platforms create a false impression of social connection but they actually cause severe harm to teenage mental health and social growth. The main issue emerges from social media platforms which use continuous comparison metrics to control user behavior.

Young people who are building their identities face an endless stream of edited social media content from their peers which sets unattainable standards for their real lives. The difference between what people show online and their actual lives leads to increasing numbers of young people developing depression and anxiety and body image problems. Research indicates that spending more than three hours per day on social media platforms leads to a double increase in mental health problems. Young users become trapped in a performance-based system of self-worth development because they seek external validation which prevents them from building enduring internal self-esteem.

The built-in features of these platforms work to replace meaningful face-to-face communication with shallow digital interactions. The transition from direct communication to indirect digital contact leads to deteriorating social abilities while creating deeper social isolation among people who stay connected online. The dangers of cyberbullying and harmful content exposure make digital connections too expensive to maintain. Society needs to shift its upcoming generations.
