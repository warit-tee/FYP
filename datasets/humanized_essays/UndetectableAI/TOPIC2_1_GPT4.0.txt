The process of repairing a damaged fan becomes achievable through following a systematic approach which leads to a rewarding experience. The initial and essential safety measure requires you to disconnect the fan from power before starting your inspection. The first step in fan inspection involves checking the outside for any signs of damage which includes loose screws and broken blades and damaged cords. The fan blades will not move properly because dust and debris have accumulated inside the fan. The protective grill needs removal to clean the blades and motor housing with a soft brush or cloth which might fix the fan's operation.

The inspection of electrical components should follow after cleaning fails to resolve the problem. Use a screwdriver to open the fan casing for inspection of its internal wiring. The fan will stop working when either the wires become loose or when they experience burnout. The multimeter allows you to verify switch and capacitor continuity. The small cylindrical capacitor functions as a starting aid for motors. Home improvement stores carry identical capacitors which you can use to replace faulty units. The motor shaft requires machine oil application for few drops to solve movement problems caused by friction.

After finishing all repairs you should reconnect the fan parts properly before testing it through a power connection. The repair of a broken fan becomes achievable through careful work with standard tools.
