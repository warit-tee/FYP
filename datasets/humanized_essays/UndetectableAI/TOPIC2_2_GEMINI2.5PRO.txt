A fan that stops working during hot summer days creates a feeling of complete disaster. Before discarding the appliance at the landfill you should attempt to bring it back to life. The repair of a broken fan turns out to be a basic process which demands more time than specialized knowledge. The process of fixing your fan will bring back comfortable air while giving you the pleasure of fixing something yourself which turns a problem into educational experience.

Your safety needs to be the first priority when starting this project. The fan needs to be unplugged from power before any tool operation to prevent electrical accidents. The tools needed for this repair include screwdrivers and a soft cloth and brush and compressed air can. The fan components need to be arranged on a flat surface which provides adequate lighting for your work. The methodical approach during repair work leads to successful reassembly of all parts.

The diagnostic process starts after you set up your work area. The main reasons for fan failure stem from two basic problems which include blockages and dirt accumulation. The protective cages that cover the blades need to be removed through clips or small screws. The fan blades need to be unscrewed from their central motor spindle after removing the protective cages. The disassembly process requires you to organize each part into a systematic arrangement. The organized arrangement of parts enables you to maintain a precise sequence for reassembly.

The solution to most problems lies in performing a complete cleaning operation. The motor housing and spindle area accumulate dust and hair which leads to overheating and motor seizure. Use your brush and cloth to clean the fan blades and cages. The motor vents should receive compressed air to remove deep-seated dust that blocks its operation. The cleaning process reveals hidden mechanical problems which were hidden by dust and debris.

The main part of the repair process starts after completing the cleaning steps. The majority of mechanical problems stem from insufficient lubrication. You should apply a few drops of household or machine oil to the bearing which is situated at the base of the spindle. Use your hands to spin the spindle while the lubricant spreads across its entire length until it achieves smooth operation. The repair of loose wires requires professional assistance when the electrical damage reaches critical levels.

The fan reassembly process requires you to follow the exact reverse sequence of disassembly steps. The fan blades need to be reattached before you secure the cages while making sure all screws achieve proper tightness to stop any movement. After completing the fan reassembly process you should plug it into power and activate the device. Your careful work should produce a peaceful fan operation that generates a refreshing breeze which demonstrates your ability to fix things.
