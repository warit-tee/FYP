Social media platforms have transformed how users interact with each other while sharing information and showing their personalities. Social media functions as a fundamental element of life for all young people who live during this present time. Young people use Instagram and TikTok and Snapchat and Twitter to create their identities while seeking validation and building social networks. Social media platforms provide users with valuable opportunities for self-expression and learning and connection but research shows these benefits are not as significant as people believe. Research indicates that social media creates severe negative impacts on young people. Social media usage among youth leads to worsened mental health problems and creates false self-perceptions while damaging their social abilities and causing them to develop addictive patterns. Social media usage among young people produces more negative effects than positive outcomes which makes it a critical matter that needs immediate resolution.

Research studies have established a direct link between social media screen time and increased rates of adolescent depression and anxiety and social isolation. The artificial perfection displayed in social media profiles creates unrealistic expectations about beauty and success and happiness. The development process of teenagers makes them susceptible to peer and influencer comparisons through social media. Users fall into a digital comparison cycle which produces negative self-perceptions and dissatisfaction. Users who see perfect lives and bodies in social media start to doubt their own worth and accomplishments which produces stress and low self-esteem. The fear of missing out (FOMO) makes young users feel worse because they believe others experience more exciting and fulfilling experiences.

Social media platforms create two major problems for young people by affecting their mental health and their self-perception and social abilities. Social media promotes a performance-based society which evaluates people through social media metrics instead of actual personality development. Young people today create social media profiles that match societal norms instead of expressing their genuine selves. People seek validation through social media which causes them to develop false self-perceptions while becoming dependent on outside validation for their self-worth and happiness. Social media trends that become popular online force young people to participate in dangerous activities for achieving online fame. The digital world establishes a system where people value looks over actual value while believing social status equals personal value.

Young people experience two major problems with their social abilities because of their social media usage. Social media enables users to exchange messages at high speed through platforms which fail to deliver meaningful emotional connections. The combination of emojis and text messages fails to deliver the complete communication experience which face-to-face interactions provide through body language and tone and emotional connection. Young people who spend most of their time on digital platforms develop poor social abilities because they struggle to start conversations and handle conflicts and read nonverbal signals. The social gap between people creates significant problems in academic and professional environments because effective communication stands as a fundamental requirement. Social media users can hide behind its anonymous environment to perform cyberbullying activities which result in harmful comments and hate speech without facing any consequences. People who experience online harassment develop emotional damage which produces enduring effects.

Social media platforms have become highly addictive for young users. The developers of social media platforms use algorithms which trigger psychological responses through variable reward systems and notification alerts to keep users engaged. Users develop a habit of continuous screen checking because they experience persistent notifications about updates and messages. The repeated behavior of screen time consumption results in decreased focus span and disrupted sleep patterns and reduced work efficiency. Young people face the highest risk of developing screen addiction because they have not learned to control their screen time usage. Young people who spend more time online end up using less time for physical activities and academic work and hobbies and face-to-face social interactions which results in an unbalanced life.Social media supporters maintain that the platform generates multiple advantages despite existing drawbacks. Social media enables young people to establish worldwide connections which develop inclusive communities that promote cultural understanding. Social media platforms enable marginalized youth including LGBTQ+ members and people with disabilities to discover support networks while sharing their experiences and promoting essential social causes. Social media platforms function as educational resources and activist platforms which enable young people to participate in social and political movements. Social media platforms enabled people to stay connected while accessing vital information during the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform's advantages do not eliminate its built-in security threats. Social media platforms show positive potential through their educational and activist features but their uncontrolled nature and toxic content and addictive design patterns dominate these benefits when youth users lack proper supervision.

A complete solution to prevent social media harm against young people requires multiple strategies. Schools and parents need to join forces to teach students about digital responsibility through digital literacy education. Students need to learn about algorithms and how to spot false information while developing skills to evaluate online content effectively. Parents need to establish proper limits while demonstrating proper social media usage to their children. Technology companies together with governments need to create new regulations which protect users from dangerous content while building suitable platforms for different age groups and making data processing systems more transparent. Young people need proper training to safely use social media platforms while maintaining awareness and self-control during their online activities.

Social media usage among young people has created major negative changes which affect their mental health and emotional stability and social relationships. Social media offers potential benefits for connection and empowerment yet its dangerous aspects including anxiety and self-esteem issues and social isolation and addiction require immediate attention. The digital transformation of society demands us to protect young people through education about digital risks and promotion of safe social media practices and platform accountability. Social media platforms will become beneficial resources for development instead of causing damage when we establish proper safety measures.
