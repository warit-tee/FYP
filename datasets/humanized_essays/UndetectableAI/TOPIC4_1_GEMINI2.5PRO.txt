The fast adoption of artificial intelligence throughout modern society creates multiple ethical problems which need thorough analysis. The growing ability maintain accountability. The creation of ethical AI systems requires more than technical solutions because society needs to define essential of advanced systems to operate independently leads us to question how they will handle matters of fairness and privacy and values which will guide digital system development.

The main ethical problem arises from the risk of algorithmic bias in AI systems. AI systems acquire knowledge through extensive dataset analysis which frequently includes biased information from past times and social environments. An unregulated AI system used for hiring will maintain discriminatory practices by selecting candidates from specific groups and judicial AI systems will generate harsher penalties through biased information. The systems need complete transparency and thorough evaluation procedures to verify their ability to deliver equal opportunities instead of intensifying existing social disparities. The absence of deliberate action will enable the development of automated prejudice at an unprecedented level.

The problem of holding responsible parties accountable for systems that operate independently continues to be a major obstacle. The process of identifying responsible parties becomes complicated when self-driving cars cause accidents or medical AI systems produce incorrect patient diagnoses. The programmer and owner and machine itself share responsibility for accidents that involve self-driving cars and medical AI system errors. The development of specific legal and ethical standards for accountability purposes will help people trust autonomous AI systems and prevent situations where victims lack any means to seek justice. The advancement of AI technology requires parallel development of oversight systems which will protect human interests while managing potential dangers.
