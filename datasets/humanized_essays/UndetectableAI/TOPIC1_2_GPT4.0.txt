Social media has become an essential part of everyday life for young people during the digital era. Instagram and TikTok and Snapchat function as communication platforms which simultaneously create identities and control behaviors and deliver entertainment and information content to users. Social media defenders claim it enables youth to connect and create while accessing knowledge yet the negative effects surpass any potential benefits. Young people who spend excessive time on social media platforms develop mental health problems and experience declining self-esteem while losing their ability to interact with others effectively thus making social media more damaging than beneficial.

Social media platforms create substantial effects on the mental state of teenagers. Research evidence shows that excessive social media usage leads to higher occurrences of anxiety disorders and depression and increased feelings of social isolation. Users of social media platforms encounter fake online content which creates unattainable beauty standards that make them feel inferior to others. Teenagers develop feelings of inadequacy after watching their friends present perfect lives on social media. The need for social media validation through likes and comments creates a destructive pattern which damages emotional health and self-assurance. Social media use can lead to severe cases of self-injury and suicidal thoughts.

Young people who spend most of their time on social media platforms develop poor abilities to interact with people face-to-face. Social media users who spend numerous hours online develop difficulties when they need to have genuine human connections. Users experience a restricted version of communication through social media because these platforms remove essential human elements from digital interactions. Young people experience difficulties when they need to have meaningful talks and handle conflicts and read non-verbal signals. Young people who stay isolated from society develop poor emotional growth because they lack essential social connections.

Social media platforms create two major problems by shortening user attention spans and harming their ability to learn and think. Users who consume online content at high speed develop a habit of seeking immediate entertainment because platforms deliver content in short bursts. Students who watch short videos online develop poor abilities to focus on extended tasks which include reading and writing and studying. The platforms use dopamine-based design to create addictive patterns which prevent users from leaving their screens to participate in activities that help them develop personal strength.

Social media platforms offer several advantages to their users. Social media enables users to express themselves while connecting with others who share their cultural background and political views. Young people can discover groups that unite them through shared interests or personal characteristics or social experiences which creates a sense of empowerment for groups who face discrimination. The uncontrolled nature of most social media platforms reveals users to dangerous content including false information and online harassment and security threats which require immediate attention. The negative effects which affect users represent fundamental problems that need immediate solutions.

Social media platforms deliver some advantages to young users but these advantages do not outweigh the negative effects they create. The current mental health emergencies and declining social abilities and reduced attention spans in young people require immediate action from educational institutions and parents and government officials. The next generation needs society to establish digital competence programs and establish healthy social media usage guidelines and promote activities that take place outside of digital spaces. Youth can achieve social media benefits through responsible usage but they need to protect themselves from its negative aspects.
